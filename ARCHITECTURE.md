```

#### State Management Strategy
1. **Server State**: Database operations handled by Prisma ORM
2. **Client State**: Minimal React state for UI interactions
3. **Global State**: React Context for application-wide settings
4. **Session State**: NextAuth.js for authentication state

#### Routing Strategy
- **App Router**: File-based routing with nested layouts
- **Dynamic Routes**: Parameterized routes for products and admin sections
- **Middleware**: Route protection and request processing
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for data operations

### Backend Architecture

#### API Design
The application follows RESTful API design principles:

```typescript
// Public API endpoints
GET    /api/products              // Fetch products with optional filtering
GET    /api/products/[slug]       // Fetch single product details
GET    /api/currencies            // Get currency conversion rates
POST   /api/orders                // Submit new orders
POST   /api/leads                 // Submit contact forms

// Admin API endpoints (authenticated)
GET    /api/admin/stats           // Dashboard statistics
GET    /api/admin/orders          // Order management
PUT    /api/admin/orders/[id]     // Update order status
POST   /api/admin/products        // Create new products
```

#### Database Schema
The Prisma schema defines the following core entities:

```prisma
model Product {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  name            String
  description     String
  priceNaira      Float    @map("price")
  stock           Int      @default(0)
  category        String
  slug            String   @unique
  featured        Boolean  @default(false)
  available       Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt

  @@map("products")
}

model Order {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  customerName    String   @map("customer_name")
  customerEmail   String   @map("customer_email")
  customerPhone   String   @map("customer_phone")
  totalAmount     Float    @map("total_amount")
  status          String   @default("new")
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt

  @@map("orders")
}

model User {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  email         String   @unique
  emailVerified DateTime? @map("email_verified")
  password      String
  role          String   @default("user")
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt

  @@map("users")
}
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Database Approach

**Decision**: Implement a hybrid data persistence strategy combining PostgreSQL with file-based configuration.

**Rationale**:
- **Development Flexibility**: File-based storage allows rapid prototyping without database setup
- **Production Scalability**: PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance and performance for production workloads
- **Data Integrity**: Structured database schema ensures data consistency
- **Migration Path**: Clear upgrade path from development to production

**Implementation**:
- Prisma ORM abstracts database operations
- File-based JSON for configuration and seed data
- Automatic migration system for schema changes

### 2. Server Components Architecture
